        <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: </p>
<p>Ibuprofen is a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for pain and inflammation treatment, by inhibiting COX-1&#x2F;2 activities. It can be administered orally and through intravenous injection, to primarily affect pain generation in neurons. However, clinical studies revealed potential negative impacts of ibuprofen on cardiac health in patients. The mechanism of the cardiac side effect is still unclear. Therefore, this study reviews past studies and proposes possible routes by which ibuprofen affects the heart.</p>
<h3 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1.Introduction"></a>1.Introduction</h3><p>Ibuprofen is a commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to reduce pain and inflammation, including short-term and long-term treatment. Due to its rapid absorption and short half-life, the suggested uptake frequency is every 6 to 8 hours. It is safer and more effective than aspirin and acetaminophen, respectively[1]. </p>
<p>Ibuprofen can be taken orally or injected intravenously. Ibuprofen can bind to proteins without causing drug-drug interactions for other highly protein-bound drugs. As ibuprofen is lipid soluble, it can cross cell membranes without transporters’ assistance. The distribution location of this drug is primarily nervous systems. In previous research, people who are under the age of five metabolize ibuprofen faster than adults. After ibuprofen absorption, approximately 10% to 15% ibuprofen is metabolized by glucuronidation [2]. Although only one percent of ibuprofen contains thiols, the metabolites may be toxic. </p>
<p>Emerging studies have indicated potential adverse effects of ibuprofen to cardiac health, such as arrhythmias. Therefore, to explore the cardiac effects of ibuprofen, this article summarizes previous findings from literature and discusses the mechanism of ibuprofen-induced heart diseases.  </p>
<h3 id="2-Possible-mechanisms"><a href="#2-Possible-mechanisms" class="headerlink" title="2.Possible mechanisms"></a>2.Possible mechanisms</h3><h4 id="2-1-Inhibition-of-COX-1-2-is-associated-with-cardiac-diseases"><a href="#2-1-Inhibition-of-COX-1-2-is-associated-with-cardiac-diseases" class="headerlink" title="2.1. Inhibition of COX-1&#x2F;2 is associated with cardiac diseases"></a>2.1. Inhibition of COX-1&#x2F;2 is associated with cardiac diseases</h4><p>Ibuprofen is known to non-selectively inhibit COX-1 and COX-2. They regulate the production of prostanoids. As a member of prostanoids, PGE2 is in the pain signaling pathway. Previous studies have shown COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition is associated with cardiovascular diseases. COX-1 inhibition will reduce blood pressure (BP), whereas COX-2 inhibition will exert a pressor effect [3]. In addition, previous research shows COX2 knockout mice had cardiac fibrosis, reduced cardiac output, and increased arrhythmogenesis [4]. It suggests COX-2 inhibition can create more stress to the cardiac system. People who use NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, etc) appear to have a higher risk of heart failure, which is associated with both dose and duration [5]. Furthermore, traditional NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, have been reported to increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), where the dose is a factor. Notably, 7-day use of ibuprofen was found to increase the MI risk [6]. Given all the previous evidence, we can conclude that the daily use of ibuprofen may pose a significant risk to cardiac health.</p>
<p>In comparison to celecoxib and naproxen, patients taking long-term ibuprofen treatment will have a higher rate of cardiac incidences, such as MI [7]. Moreover, ibuprofen uptake is more likely to cause hypertension [8].</p>
<h4 id="2-2-Increased-PP1-level-contributes-to-heart-damage"><a href="#2-2-Increased-PP1-level-contributes-to-heart-damage" class="headerlink" title="2.2. Increased PP1 level contributes to heart damage"></a>2.2. Increased PP1 level contributes to heart damage</h4><p>PP1, type 1 protein phosphatase, is an important protein in many processes in cells. In the heart, PP1 is responsible for contractions and calcium handling [9]. This protein phosphatase, which is highly associated with HF, is upregulated by ibuprofen treatment in rat cardiac cells [10]. Mitochondrial functions are negatively affected by ibuprofen, posing metabolic challenges to the heart. Also, Ibuprofen increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can damage cells [11].</p>
<h4 id="2-3-Ibuprofen-inhibits-NaV1-8-in-cardiomyocytes"><a href="#2-3-Ibuprofen-inhibits-NaV1-8-in-cardiomyocytes" class="headerlink" title="2.3. Ibuprofen inhibits NaV1.8 in cardiomyocytes"></a>2.3. Ibuprofen inhibits NaV1.8 in cardiomyocytes</h4><p>Ibuprofen is known to inhibit NaV1.8 in nociceptors in order to reduce pain production [12]. However, this type of Na+ channel also exists in cardiomyocytes, where the channels are expressed near the gap junction. Therefore, NaV1.8 may modulate electrical conduction in the heart. The change of electrical conduction may be a reason behind arrhythmia, given the well-established model of re-entry [13]. A previous study showed that the inhibition of NaV1.8 leads to shorter action potential durations, which can be another contributor to arrhythmias [14] (Figure 1). </p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Conclusion and discussion<br>Based on all the previous results, I can conclude that the inhibition of COX-1&#x2F;2 through ibuprofen administration increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as MI and heart failure. From a more mechanistic perspective, ibuprofen can affect mitochondrial functions and increase the level of PP1, a marker associated with HF. Additionally, ROS level can be increased by ibuprofen. Lastly, ibuprofen inhibits NaV1.8, an ion channel present in both neurons and cardiomyocytes, to affect action potentials and its conduction. The electrical changes can be a reason of arrhythmias.<br>Although previous studies have already indicated possible pathways, there are only a few mechanistic studies in human hearts. The sparse data from human hearts limits our understanding of ibuprofen’s side effects. Therefore, future research requires more human-derived models, such as engineered hearts, to accomplish a deeper understanding.</li>
